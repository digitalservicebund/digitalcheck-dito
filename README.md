The website code for [_Digitalcheck: Digitaltaugliche Regelung erarbeiten_](https://digitalcheck.bund.de).
Built with [Astro](https://astro.build/) as a static site, with React for interactive parts (see [ADR 27](./doc/adr/0027-migrate-to-astro.md)).

## Setup

### 1. Node.js & Dependencies

We aim to use the current active [LTS version of nodejs](https://nodejs.dev/en/about/releases/). We use [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) to manage the runtimes and tools for development.

You need to have mise installed on your computer; see the [mise installation docs](https://mise.jdx.dev/installing-mise.html) for the available options.

Install the dependencies by [integrating mise into your shell](https://mise.jdx.dev/getting-started.html#activate-mise).

### 2. Git Hooks

The project uses [Lefthook](https://github.com/evilmartians/lefthook) to manage Git hooks. These hooks help ensure code quality and security before you commit and push.

To activate the hooks, run:

```bash
./run.sh init
```

The following hooks are configured in `lefthook.yml`:

- **On `git commit`**:
  - `commitlint`: Enforces [conventional commit messages](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).
  - `lint`: Fixes and checks for linting errors in staged files.
  - `format`: Formats staged files using Prettier.
  - `talisman` & `gitleaks`: Scan for secrets and sensitive information in your commit.
- **On `git push`**:
  - `licenses-audit`: Verifies that dependency licenses comply with the project's policy.

### 3. Playwright Browsers

For end-to-end (E2E) and accessibility (a11y) testing with [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro), you need to install the required browser binaries:

```bash
pnpm exec playwright install
```

## Staging-only Features

Unreleased features are shown on staging and locally, but hidden in production (see [ADR 28](./doc/adr/0028-stage-based-feature-flags.md)):

- **Parts of a page:** check `isProduction` from `src/config/stage.ts`.
- **Whole pages:** set `isStagingOnly: true` in the page's route metadata.

To release a feature, remove the check.

## Development

### Run Locally

Start the app in development mode. It will automatically rebuild assets when you change a file.

```sh
pnpm dev
```

### Testing

The project includes unit, end-to-end, and accessibility tests.

- Run unit tests (with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)): `pnpm test`
- Run end-to-end tests (with [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/)): `pnpm test:e2e`
- Run accessibility tests (with [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro) & [Axe](https://www.deque.com/axe/)): `pnpm test:a11y`
- Run all tests sequentially: `pnpm tests`

#### Snapshot Testing

This package supports snapshot testing via [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-snapshots) and [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/guide/snapshot.html). Snapshots are useful for verifying that UI components and layouts have not changed unexpectedly.

##### Playwright Snapshot Testing

The snapshot tests capture screenshots of static routes across different devices, as defined in `tests/playwright-snapshots.config.ts`.

- Create initial snapshots: `pnpm test:snapshots`. On the first run, this command generates the baseline snapshots.
- If you've made intentional changes and need to update the snapshots: `pnpm test:update-snapshots`.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Snapshots currently only cover static routes, not dynamic ones.
> - Snapshot tests can sometimes be flaky, especially for Webkit/Safari, due to minor rendering differences.
> - Tablet-sized viewports are not currently included in the snapshot configuration.

##### Vitest Snapshot Testing

To create a component snapshot with Vitest, use `toMatchSnapshot()` in your test file. For example:

```ts
// In a test like src/layout/Footer.spec.tsx
const { container } = render(<Footer />);
expect(container).toMatchSnapshot();
```

To update failing snapshots, run all tests and press `u` in the interactive prompt, or use the update flag directly:

```sh
pnpm test -- -u
```

For more details, see the [Vitest Snapshot documentation](https://vitest.dev/guide/snapshot.html#updating-snapshots).

### Code Quality (Linting & Formatting)

The project uses [ESLint](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/) for linting and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/en/) for formatting. It's recommended to set up the [Git Hooks](#2-git-hooks) to automate this process.

- Check formatting: `pnpm format`
- Autofix formatting issues: `pnpm format:fix`
- Check for linting errors: `pnpm lint`
- Autofix linting issues: `pnpm lint:fix`
- Check types: `pnpm typecheck`

## Build for Production

To build the application for production:

```sh
pnpm build
```

This creates a static site in the `dist/` directory.

To preview the production build locally:

```sh
pnpm preview
```

## Deployment

### Docker

You can build and run the application in a Docker container to simulate the production environment. The image serves the static build with nginx on http://localhost:8080.

```sh
pnpm docker:dev
```

Stop the container with `pnpm docker:stop`.

### DIY

The output of `pnpm build` in `dist/` is a static site that can be served by any web server.
